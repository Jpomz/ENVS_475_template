## About


## Preliminaries 

### Packages  

For this lab, we will be using the `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `Sleuth3` and the `car` packages. Make sure all packages are installed on your computer (you may need to install `Sleuth3` and `car`), and then run the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(Sleuth3)
library(car)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


## Data  

We will be using a data set from the `Sleuth3` package called `case1402` . This is data from an experiment examining the yield of different soybean varieties under different conditions of Ozone, SO2 and drought.  See `?case1402` for more information.  

## Load data and rename object

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df <- case1402
```

```{r}
head(df)
```
* `William`: Response variable, continuous, needs to be `log()` transformed  
* `O3`: Predictor variable, continuous  
* `Stress`: Predictor variable, categorical/factor  
  * Levels: `Stressed`, `Well-watered` 
  
### Transform `William` variable

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(log_william = log(William))
```

  
# Plot data  

Scatterplot with continuous *x*- and *y*-variables. 

```{r}
ggplot(df,
       aes(x = O3, 
           y = log_william)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
ggplot(df,
       aes(x = O3, 
           y = log_william)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
### Factor  

```{r}
ggplot(df, 
       aes(y = log_william, 
           x = Stress,
           color = Stress)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = NULL)) +
  theme_bw()
```


### Plot both predictor variables  

```{r}
ggplot(df,
       aes(x = O3, 
           y = log_william,
           color = Stress)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```
#### With `geom_smooth()`  

```{r}
ggplot(df,
       aes(x = O3, 
           y = log_william,
           color = Stress,
           fill = Stress)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

# Fit ANCOVA model  

```{r}
df_lm <- lm(log_william ~ O3 * Stress, data = df)
```

## Assumptions  

```{r}
ggplot(df, 
       aes(sample = log_william)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line()
```

```{r}
ggplot(df_lm, 
       aes( x = .fitted, 
            y = .resid)) +
  geom_point()
```

## ANOVA table

```{r}
anova(df_lm)
```
**Interpretation**: There is a significant main effect of `O3` ($F_{1, 26} = 51.92$, $p < 0.001$) and a significant main effect of `Stress` ($F_{1, 26} = 10.84$, $p = 0.002$). There was no significant interactive effect ($F_{1, 26} = 0.46$, $p = 0.5$). 

Plain words: There was a relationship between yield ( `log_william` ) and `O3` (continuous predictor variable). Likewise, there was a difference in average yield based on the `Stress` factor (categorical predictor variable, different intercepts for each group). The relationship between yield and ozone was not dependent on the stress factor, and vice versa (both groups had the same slope).  

## Linear model summary  

```{r}
summary(df_lm)
```

### Equation for line 1: `Stressed`  

* (Intercept) $\beta_0$: Estimate = 8.49; This is the average yield for the `Stressed` treatment when Ozone = 0.  
* `O3` $\beta_1$: Estimate = -6.47; For every 1-unit increase in Ozone, the average yield changes by -6.47.  

$$ \text{Yield}_{Stressed} = 8.49 - 6.47 * \text{Ozone}$$

### Equation for line 2: `Well-watered`  

* `StressWell-watered`: This is the estimated difference in intercepts for the two treatment groups. Estimate = $\beta_0 + \beta_{well-watered} = 8.49 + 1.916 = 10.41$; This is the average yield for the `Well-watered` treatment when Ozone = 0.  
* `O3:Stresswell-watered`: This is the estimated difference in slopes for the two treatment groups (but note that the p-value > 0.05, so we fail to reject the NULL that this coefficient is 0). Estimate = $-6.47 - 1.35 = -7.82$.  

$$ \text{Yield}_{well-watered} = (8.49 + 1.916) - (6.47 - 1.35) * \text{Ozone} = 10.41 - 7.82 * \text{Ozone}$$

Note that these equations will be slightly different from what `geom_smooth(method = "lm")` will estimate. To see how to plot the estimated model fits in `ggplot`, see the appendix of this lab. 

## Coda

This concludes lab 08  

# Appendix: Plotting model estimates  

* Make a new data frame with values of predictor variables  

```{r}
new_x <- expand.grid(
  O3 = seq(from = min(df$O3),
           to = max(df$O3), 
                    length.out = 10),
  Stress = levels(df$Stress))
head(new_x)
```
* Predict values of y based on model fit (`df_lm`) and `new_x`  

```{r}
new_y <- predict(df_lm, 
                 newdata = new_x,
                 interval = "confidence")
head(new_y)
```
* combine `new_x` and `new_y` in a data frame to add to the plot  

```{r}
fit_data <- data.frame(new_x,
                       new_y)
head(fit_data)
```
* Plot original data  
```{r}
ggplot(df,
       aes(x = O3, 
           y = log_william,
           color = Stress,
           fill = Stress)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() 
```
* add a `geom_smooth()` layer  
* instead of using automatic calculations (`method = "lm"`), specify `fit_data`  

```{r}
ggplot(df,
       aes(x = O3, 
           y = log_william,
           color = Stress,
           fill = Stress)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(data = fit_data,
              aes(y = fit, 
                  ymin = lwr, 
                  ymax = upr), 
                  stat = "identity")
```
