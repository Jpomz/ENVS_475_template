# Data

For this homework assignment, we will be working with real data from ["Darwin's Finches"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_finches) in the Galapagos Islands. Famously, the variation in beak sizes of these birds is one of the observations which is often credited to Darwin's formulation of his Theory of Natural Selection (although in reality he just [brought back finch](https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/darwins-barnacles#:~:text=But%20the%20truth%20is%2C%20Darwin,an%20expert%20back%20in%20England) specimens, and museum archivists were the ones to realize the diversity of species on the islands).

The beaks of the Galapagos finches was the primary detail of interest. For birds, beaks are the primary tool at their disposal, and the type (size, shape, etc.) of beak you have determines what type of food resources that are available to you, and the types of "jobs" you can do. 


Regardless of Darwin's personal affinity (or lack thereof) for these birds, they have nonetheless played an outsized role in the history of biology. In more recent times, Drs. Peter and Rosemary Grant have spent decades on the islands following the birds through time and documenting changes in Finch morphology in response to drought and other environmental conditions. Their work has been well documented, including in the popular science book [*Beak of the finch*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/125286.The_Beak_of_the_Finch) by Jonathan Weiner, and much of this work is summarized in an [educational documentary on HHMI](https://youtu.be/mcM23M-CCog). 

In this homework assignment, we will be working with a subset of the Grants' beak measurement data for two of the species, *Geospiza fortis*, and *G. scandens*, collected on Daphne Major Island in 1975 and 2012. The full data set is available at [Data Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.g6g3h)

## Download the data and read into R

Be sure to download the data `galapago-finches.csv` and from D2L and place them both in your `data/` folder in your R project. 

Copy the following code and put it at the top of your homework script:

```{r}
finch <- read.csv("data/galapago-finches.csv")
```


# Exercises Homework 05: point estimates

## Problem 1: Data Wrangling

1. Get to know your data by using the `names()`, `dim()`,  `head()`, and `str()` functions.  

2. which species are present? To determine this, use the following code: `unique(finch$species)`

3. Split the data based on species, and make two new data frames, one called `fortis` and one called `scandens`.  
  * hint: use the `filter()` function from dplyr.  
  * Remember to use `==` in the filter function  
  * here is the code for the fortis species:  
    + `fortis <- finch %>% filter(species == "fortis")`

4. Now that you have an object for each species, split each of these based on year.  
  * you should end up with a total of 4 objects called the following:  
    + `fortis1975`  
    + `fortis2012`  
    + `scandens1975`  
    + `scandens2012`  
  
5. print out the dimensions of all four of your new objects using the `dim()` function. Do these dimensions make sense? You may want to rerun the `dim()` from problem 1.1 above. 
  

## Problem 2: `fortis1975`

1. Use `ggplot()` to make separate histograms for both the `blength` and the `bdepth` variables.  
  * You should make two separate plots (not a faceted plot)  
  * for your aesthetics, you should map your variable of interest to the x axis:  
    + `aes(x = blength)`  
  * Make sure to add a `+` at the end of each function in order to add another layer. 
    + Do not add a `+` at the last line.  
  * Set the number of bins to 15 by adding the following geom layer: `geom_histogram(bins = 15)`  
  * use the `labs(title = "...")` function to add a title with the species name and year.  
  * You can add `theme_bw()` if you want to.  
  * Under each plot, comment on whether or not you think these variables appear to be normally distributed.  
    + Make sure you begin each line of your interpretation answer with a `#` to make it a comment in your R scipt.  


2. Calculate the mean, SD, and SEM for `blength` for the `fortis1975` object.  
  * you may want to save each of these as a new object.  
  
3. Calculate an approximate 95% and a 99% Confidence Interval for beak length for the *fortis* species from 1975.  
  * Hint: by approximate I mean assume a normal distribution, so your 95% CI will have a `2*` and your 99% will have a `3*` in the calculation.  
  * **Bonus** calculate these intervals in a way that the  lower and upper bounds print out as a single vector  


4. Interpret just the 95% CI here.  
  * make sure to start your interpretation with a `#` in your R script.  

## Problem 3 `fortis2012`

1. Calculate the mean, SD and SEM for beak length for the *fortis* species from 2012.  

2. Calculate a 95% and 99% CI for beak length for the *fortis* species from 2012.  

3. Compare and interpret the 95% CIs for the *fortis* species from 1975 and 2012.  
  * Hint: Do the intervals cross?  
  * Is the mean beak length different between the years?  
  * How "confident" are we?  

## Problem 4 `scandens` beak depth  

1. Calculate the mean, SD, SEM, and 95% confidence interval for the `blength` variable for the *scandens* species in both 1975 and 2012. 

2. Interpret the 95% confidence intervals for the *scandens* species in the two years.  
  * Hint: Do the intervals cross?  
  * Is the mean beak length different between the years?  
  * How "confident" are we?  
  
3. 

## Problem 5 Challenge (optional)

In the above example we split the original data object into four based on combinations of finch species and survey year. However, we could have performed all of these calculations on the original data set using `dplyr`. 
Using `dplyr` functions and the original, complete, `finch` data object, calculate the mean, sd, sem, and 95% CIs for beak length for each combination of year, and species.  

**Hints**  
* Recall the `group_by()` function.  
* `summarize()` collapses a large data set down to one row per group  
* the `mutate()` function can be used to make new column(s) based on calculations using values already in columns.
